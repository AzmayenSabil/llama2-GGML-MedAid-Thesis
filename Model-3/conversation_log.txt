BC30267: "No overloads match this call"
======================================

This error can be caused by the following possible causes:

1. The method or property is abstract.

2. The method or property is virtual, but it is being called with an argument that is not a valid base class for the current class.

3. The method or property is declared with the `Overrides` keyword, but there are no override clauses for it in the current class or its base classes.

4. The method or property is declared with the `Sub` keyword and does not have a body.

5. The method or property is inherited from a base class, but the base class's override clause has been removed.

6. The method or property is inherited from a base class, but there is no override clause in the current class.

7. The method or property is inherited from a base class, but there is no inheritance declaration for the base class in the current file.

To resolve this error, you need to either remove the base class from the override clause or add an inheritance declaration for it. You can also modify the override clause to specify which base classes should be considered for the current class. Alternatively, you can add a new base class declaration to the current class to overcome the issue. # DualStacking in NimbusDNS

## Overview
NimbusDNS supports multiple DNS zones on one host using dual stack IP addresses (HTTPS + IP). This feature allows users to use HTTPS services like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for their domains without having to buy an SSL certificate from a third party. However, the dual stack functionality requires some work to configure.

In this guide, we will walk through how to enable dual stack support using the `nimbusdns` module in Nimbus.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine.

## Configuring the NimbusDNS Module

1. Create a new file named `config" [/Model Response]
